## Convolutional Neural Network with the following techniques:  
  3 layers with a fully-connected layer  
  ~~dropout~~ (doesn't work well when combined with batch normalization according to https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.05134.pdf)
  batch normalization  
  xavier initialization for weights  
  zero initialization for biases  
  max pooling  
  cross entropy  
  learning rate decay
  early stopping
